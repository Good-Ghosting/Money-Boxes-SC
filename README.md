# MoneyBoxes

MoneyBoxes is an MVP developed for intelligently segmenting and allocating your crypto paycheque using Request Network and Gnosis network/ Gnosis Safe. Users can create payment requests via Request Network, directed to a Gnosis Safe contract. The solution allows for managing and logically distributing safe funds into various user-configurable "money boxes."

## Overview

MoneyBoxes serves as an automated allocation system, reducing the need for manual distribution of funds after each payment receipt. This significantly streamlines the accounting processes of web3 workers and freelancers,

For instance, a user might establish three distinct money boxes:

1. Taxes (30% allocation)
2. Travel Savings (10% allocation)
3. Investment (25% allocation)

Each money box in our system could possess the capability of investing in third-party strategies, like Aave or Curve, or convert all funds within a specific box into DAI. (Not implemented in this MVP)
